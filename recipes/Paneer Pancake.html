        <h4>Recipe Of Paneer Pancake</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Beat eggs in a clean and dry bowl till light and fluffy.</li>
          <li>
            Add sugar and beat till the sugar is combined. Stir in the smooth
            paneer, baking powder, plain flour and salt to the beaten egg
            mixture. Add the milk and whisk to combine well. You should have a
            thick pancake batter.

            Heat a skillet over low heat. Melt some butter and pour in a large
            ladle of the paneer pancake batter onto the pan. The batter will
            spread on its own and settle down.

          <li>
            When you notice bubbles appear on top, flip over and cook the paneer
            pancake the other side.
